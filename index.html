        <h3>Who am I ?</h3>
        <p>
            Hi my name is JoÃ£o Victor Saraiva, I am from Brazil, Ceara Fortaleza, actually I am 20 years old refference
            Date -> (08/17/2022).
            My most works are done with ruby on rails, but i also flert with node as well, just one year to finish college.
            I really love to install
            random stuffs on my linux, sometimes it breaks, but alright thats part of the job. 
        </p>

        <h3>Why i started ?</h3>
        <p>
            I actually do remember that, i came to my friend house he was doing a random calculator website, and i looked into his vscode theme and i was in love
            with the colors it was a silly reason but when i came at home i installed and learn how games were made. After that i never stopped coding, its kind off if I past a day
            without coding anything. Here is where i can be creative, the things we programmers can create are beyond imagination and that is incredible, and this is the reason I dont stop,
            my own limit its me.
        </p>

        <h3>How i started ?</h3>
        <p>
            I first try frontend but i realize that center a div and use color wheel was definetly not my thing, i always enjoy
            code challanges, so to me it was kinda odd do this stuff.
            But it was when i discovered ruby that everything changed, i was(am) in loving with this language, with ruby i got
            my first job and create most of my projects, its a powerfull language some pepople look down on ruby but that is a
            huge mistake.
        </p>

        <h3>My experiences</h3>
        <p>
            My main experience it is in ruby, i work on a town hall system that do accounting, contracts, iventory and etc.
            I aint gonna lie its kinda hard works with government systems but i do enjoy the challange, i also work in a feel
            gems, but my main priority right now is to finish a gem that can define a pattern into a .txt and validate if 
            the file had this pattern, its a very specific problem but it is a thing that i faced twice.
        </p>

        <h3>My goals</h3>
        <p>
            I search a good oportunity outside the country, its a dream and iam working hard to make it real. Obviously
            improve my knowledge, and help most pepople that i can with programming, its not a thing that I said until now but
            I enjoy teah programming, not in a profissional way but casually.
